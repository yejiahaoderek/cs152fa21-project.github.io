# Plant/Flower Recognition & Diagnosis App
A project proposal for CS 152

## Project Description
People without expertise in plant/flower always find it difficult to identify the plant/flower they encounter with. The greater of needs of plant recognition arise from situations where someone buying a new plant but does not know how to take care of it or receving a flower from others but has no idea about the symbolic meaning. 

I want to develop an app that tackles this problem. I will focus on training neural networks (NNs) for the recognition & diagonosis for plants. The project could be implemented in either of the following two directions. 1) Borader focus: train the NN to identify the species, health conditions, as well as planting advice of the plant in the input picture; 2) Narrower focus: train the NN to identify the type/name and symbolic meaning of the flower in the input picture. 


## Project Goals
1. Create/find a dataset for training a NN for plant/flower recognition
2. Train the NN with high prediction accuracy
3. Evaluate the performance of the NN
4. Deploy the NN on cellphones and create a simple app

Given that there might be similar works conducted for this topic, further steps could be
- Optimize the NN to produce higher accuracy
- Compare/evaluate the performance of differnent NN architecture
- Compress the NN so that it could run on cellphones
- Create a more user-friendly app that deploys the NN
