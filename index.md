A project for CS152

## Introduction
People without expertise in plant care always find it difficult to identify the plants they encounter. The need for plant recognition and plant pathology software arise from situations where people buy or receive new plants but do not know how to take care of them.

We want to develop an app that tackles this problem. We will focus on training neural networks to recognize plants as well as diagnose certain plant-related ailments. The project will be implemented to train the NN to identify the species, health conditions, and the app should offer some planting advice for the plant in the input picture.
The primary limitation of the project involves the two pronged nature of the app. Classifying plants by species and identifying plant ailments will require separate datasets and perhaps disease classification which discolors or damages distinctive plant features will interfere with species classification. 

Ideally, we would want to efficiently and accurately be able to classify plants and any diseases they may be suffering from. The benchmark accuracy isn’t something we know right now and hopefully as we progress with the project, we’ll get more clarity about our goals. 
We do not see any glaring ethical problems with this project but we will do some ethical exploration of other topics in AI, specifically, targeted advertisement.


## Project Goals
1. Create/find a dataset for training a NN for plant recognition
2. Train the NN with high prediction accuracy
3. Evaluate the performance of the NN
4. Deploy the NN on cellphones and create a simple app

Given that there might be similar works conducted for this topic, further steps could be
- Optimize the NN to produce higher accuracy
- Compare/evaluate the performance of differnent NN architecture
- Compress the NN so that it could run on cellphones
- Create a more user-friendly app that deploys the NN
